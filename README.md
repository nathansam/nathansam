### Research

My research focuses on predicting outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). I am taking a holistic approach to modelling these outcomes by considering diet and lifestyle factors alongside whole-genome and metabolomic sequencing data as part of the [PREdiCCt study](https://www.predicct.co.uk). I am interested in also incorporating longitudinal measurements, such as blood results, in my models. 

I am supervised by [Dr Catalina Vallejos](https://github.com/catavallejos) and [Professor Charlie Lees](https://charlielees.com) and financially supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC). 

My [talks repository](https://github.com/nathansam/talks) contains PDF files of slides from presentations I have given.

### About Me

After completing a Mathematics undergraduate degree from Aberystwyth university, where I primarily focused on statistics and pure mathematics, I studied an MSc in Statistics for Computational Biology at the same institution. I am now a PhD student in the [Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/) led by [Dr Catalina Vallejos](https://github.com/catavallejos) at the University of Edinburgh. I am a student on the Precision Medicine doctoral training programme. I have also worked on [DECOVID](https://www.decovid.org) as an analyst.

My personal interests include fitness and all things tech (especially PC hardware :desktop_computer:).
